# Deployment Workflow - No More Regressions! üöÄ

## The Problem You Were Having
- Replit Publishing was causing regressions
- Working features would break after deployments
- No reliable way to test before going live

## The Solution: Proper Staging Pipeline

### Development Workflow (Daily)

#### 1. Develop in Replit ‚úÖ
- Build and test features here
- Use Replit "Publish" ONLY for quick demos (expect data resets)
- **Never use Replit Publish for important testing**

#### 2. When Feature is Ready ‚Üí GitHub
```bash
# In Replit Git pane:
1. Stage your changes
2. Commit with message: "feat: add contract 3-dot menu functionality"
3. Push to 'develop' branch
```

#### 3. Staging Auto-Deploys ‚Üí Test Everything
- Render automatically deploys from 'develop' branch
- Test ALL existing features (not just new ones)
- Use checklist below

#### 4. Production Deploy (Only when staging passes)
- Merge 'develop' ‚Üí 'main'
- Production deploys from 'main' branch
- Rollback available if issues

### Pre-Deploy Testing Checklist ‚úÖ

Before each production deploy, test on staging:

**Core Features:**
- [ ] Login/logout works
- [ ] Contracts table loads
- [ ] 3-dot menu: View, Edit, Delete all work
- [ ] Create new contract works
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Invoices section accessible
- [ ] Customer management works

**Quick Smoke Test:**
1. Open staging URL
2. Login as test user
3. Navigate to contracts
4. Test 3-dot menu on existing contract
5. Create one new contract
6. Check no console errors

### Environment Setup

**Staging Environment:**
- URL: `https://your-app-staging.onrender.com`
- Database: Separate staging database
- Test data: Safe to modify/delete

**Production Environment:**
- URL: `https://your-app.onrender.com`
- Database: Live production data
- Deploy only from tested staging

### Rollback Plan üîÑ

If production breaks:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click "Rollback to previous deployment"
3. Fix issue in Replit
4. Test on staging
5. Redeploy when fixed

### Key Rules to Follow

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Always test on staging before production
- Use separate staging and production databases
- Commit working code to GitHub
- Follow the checklist

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use Replit Publish for important testing
- Deploy directly to production without staging
- Skip the testing checklist
- Deploy when tired/rushed

### Emergency Contacts

If something breaks in production:
1. Rollback immediately
2. Debug on staging (never production)
3. Test fix thoroughly
4. Redeploy only when confirmed working

**This workflow eliminates your regression problems by ensuring every deployment is tested and reversible.**

You are enhancing an existing Node.js accounting system named **Taxnify** with a working General Entry module. Now build a fully functional **Bulk Capture Module** using the exact structure and logic from the General Entry module.

### ðŸ§© GOAL:
- Capture multiple Income or Expense entries in a single form/table
- Use the same date format, validation, and accounting logic as the General Entry module
- Fix all known issues, especially around dates (string expected), null constraints, and missing account links

---

### ðŸ”§ TECH STACK
- Node.js backend (Express, Prisma or Sequelize for DB)
- React frontend (with modals and table entry forms)
- Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap for styling
- PostgreSQL database

---

### ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE OVERVIEW

1. **Bulk Capture Page** (`/bulk-capture`)
   - Let user select `Entry Type`: `Income` or `Expense`
   - Allow multiple rows with inputs:
     - `Transaction Date` (use `YYYY-MM-DD`, match General Entry logic)
     - `Description`
     - `Reference` (optional)
     - `Account` (dropdown from COA)
     - `Debit` / `Credit`
     - `VAT Type` (dropdown or auto if applicable)
   - Pre-fill or auto-assign:
     - Bank Account
     - Revenue Account / Expense Account
     - VAT Accounts (based on entry type)

2. **Validation**
   - Match logic from General Entry: total debits = total credits per row
   - Date must be `string` (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
   - Account, amount, and description must not be null

3. **Upload Integration (Optional Phase)**
   - Allow PDF/JPG upload per row for scanned receipts/invoices
   - File should attach to journal entry as a receipt proof

4. **Smart Suggestions (Optional Phase 2)**
   - Use filename or uploaded text to suggest account mappings (if OCR enabled)

### ðŸ“¦ DATABASE STRUCTURE (Reuse Existing)

Use the same schema as General Entry:
```ts
journal_entries {
  id
  entry_number
  transaction_date (string)
  description
  reference
  created_by
}

journal_lines {
  id
  journal_entry_id
  account_id
  description
  debit
  credit
}

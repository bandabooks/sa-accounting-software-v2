Prompt (paste into Replit AI / Ghostwriter):

Act as a senior Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind UI engineer and redesign our landing page using the same copy, links, and images that exist today.

Create a new component file:

If using App Router: app/landingpage-pro/page.tsx

If using Pages Router: pages/landingpage-pro.tsx
Export a default React component named LandingPagePro.

Design goals

Professional, modern, and unique—clean typography, generous white space, subtle motion, and consistent spacing.

Fully centered layout: no right-side whitespace, no horizontal scroll. Use a centered container mx-auto max-w-screen-xl px-4 (or equivalent) and never use 100vw for sections.

Responsive: great on 320px → 1440px.

Accessible: semantic HTML, labeled controls, focus states, contrast ≥ WCAG 2.2 AA, skip-to-content link.

Tech & libraries

Tailwind CSS (preferred)

lucide-react for icons

framer-motion for gentle fade/slide on hero, features, and CTA (reduced motion respected)

Optional: shadcn/ui components (Buttons, Cards, Badge)

Content

Reuse all current text and links from the existing landing page (headlines, subhead, CTAs like “Start Free Trial”, trust badges: “SARS Integrated”, “CIPC Compliant”, “500+ SA Firms”, features, etc.). If any asset path is unknown, keep the same visible text and use a placeholder image block.

Sections to include (same content, improved layout)

Header: logo left, compact nav with dropdowns, “Sign In” + primary CTA (“Start Free Trial”) right. Sticky on scroll.

Hero: gradient background, bold headline + subhead (existing text), primary CTA, secondary CTA, small trust indicators.

Feature grid (3–6 cards): icons + titles + short blurbs (reuse existing copy).

Compliance/Integrations: SARS/CIPC badges with short reassurance text.

Social proof: “500+ SA Firms” with small logo row or stat highlights.

Pricing teaser: brief summary with link to full pricing.

Final CTA bar: centered, high-contrast.

Footer: compact columns, legal, and contact.

Styling direction

Palette: keep brand purple/indigo; add a tasteful accent (e.g., gold for emphasis).

Cards: rounded-2xl, soft shadow, 1px border on light surfaces.

Buttons: solid primary, subtle hover/pressed states, focus-visible rings.

Typography: use system stack or Inter; clear hierarchy (text-4xl/5xl hero, text-lg body).

Animation

framer-motion fade/slide in on viewport; disable when prefers-reduced-motion.

Overflow & centering rules (must-haves)

Global: html, body { overflow-x: hidden; }

All sections w-full (not 100vw).

Containerized layout with mx-auto max-w-screen-xl px-4.

Deliverables

The new page file with all sections implemented.

Any minor Tailwind config additions if needed.

Update the nav to include a link to /landingpage-pro.

Add basic <Head>/metadata (title, description) copied from the current page.

Ensure build runs with no TypeScript errors.

Acceptance criteria

Visually centered at all breakpoints; no horizontal scrollbar.

Reuses exact copy from current landing.

Lighthouse Accessibility ≥ 90 on desktop.

CTAs clearly visible and keyboard navigable.

Suggestions

Name it landing-pro.tsx or route it at /pro for easy A/B testing.

Keep the old page live; add a feature flag or query param to toggle between versions.

After generation, run a quick pass for real device widths (375, 768, 1024, 1440).

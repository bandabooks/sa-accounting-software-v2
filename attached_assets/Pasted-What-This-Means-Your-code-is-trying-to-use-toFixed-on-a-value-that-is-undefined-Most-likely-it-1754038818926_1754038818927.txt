What This Means
Your code is trying to use .toFixed() on a value that is undefined.

Most likely, itâ€™s trying to format/display a price, amount, or total, but the variable is missing, null, or not initialized.

How to Fix This
1. Find the Failing Line
The error is in pos-terminal.tsx at line 409.

Example of what the buggy code probably looks like:

js
Copy
Edit
let amount = someObject?.amount;
let formatted = amount.toFixed(2); // ðŸ’¥ amount is undefined!
2. Add a Defensive Check Before Using .toFixed()
Replace:

js
Copy
Edit
let formatted = amount.toFixed(2);
With:

js
Copy
Edit
let formatted = (typeof amount === "number" ? amount : 0).toFixed(2);
Or, for cleaner code, use optional chaining and nullish coalescing:

js
Copy
Edit
let formatted = (amount ?? 0).toFixed(2);
3. Where to Check
Look for any place in pos-terminal.tsx where you do something like:

item.total.toFixed(2)

cart.amount.toFixed(2)

price.toFixed(2)

And make sure price, amount, or whatever variable is never undefined or null.

4. Example Fix
Original Code:
js
Copy
Edit
return <span>{total.toFixed(2)}</span>;
Fixed Code:
js
Copy
Edit
return <span>{(total ?? 0).toFixed(2)}</span>;
Or, if the value could also be a string (rare for amounts), do:

js
Copy
Edit
return <span>{Number(total ?? 0).toFixed(2)}</span>;
5. Test
Fix all instances in the POS Terminal code where .toFixed() could be called on an undefined value.

Save and redeploy or restart your frontend.

Reload /pos/terminal and check if the screen now loads without errors.

Prompt to Use With Developer/Agent
Issue:
POS Terminal fails to load. The error is:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed') at POSTerminal (pos-terminal.tsx:409:46)

Fix:

Review all usages of .toFixed() in pos-terminal.tsx and related files.

Ensure any value passed to .toFixed() is always a valid number, using (amount ?? 0).toFixed(2) or Number(amount ?? 0).toFixed(2).

Add fallback/default values if data is missing or not loaded yet.

Test POS Terminal for all user flows, including with empty carts, uninitialized state, etc.

System-Wide VAT Types and Dropdown Field Consistency
Checklist & Implementation Rules:
First, VERIFY if each sub-feature exists before implementing.

If missing, create and integrate it seamlessly into the existing structure.

DO NOT duplicate logic or data structures—reuse and reference existing tables/models.

Ensure everything is mobile and tablet friendly.

Respect user roles and permissions.

Prompt:
1. VAT Types Consistency

Check the database for duplicate VAT types or groups.

There should be only one master list/group of VAT types (e.g., VAT Inclusive, VAT Exclusive, Zero Rated, Exempt, No VAT).

Remove or merge any duplicate VAT types across the system—ensure only the official master group is available everywhere.

The VAT types available in the Bulk Capture module must be the same as those used in Product Creation, Invoice Creation, and Estimate modules.

All modules should reference the same VAT type table/model.

2. Dropdown Integration

On Product Creation, Invoice Creation, and Estimate Creation pages, the VAT Type must be a dropdown field.

The VAT dropdown must list all options from the unified VAT type group (no duplicates).

Selecting a VAT type on a product should automatically use the same type when the product is added to an invoice or estimate.

The dropdowns should be clear, searchable, and responsive on all devices.

3. Email Configuration

Verify that system-wide outgoing email (SMTP/API) is configured (check .env or config files, and admin settings panel).

If not configured, prompt the user/admin with a clear message or setup wizard.

Test sending a sample email (invoice, notification, etc.) to ensure everything is working.

4. Integration Check

All transactions—whether captured in bulk or one-by-one—must use the same VAT logic and dropdown source.

Updates to VAT types in settings or admin panel should reflect system-wide immediately.

5. Remove Legacy/Duplicate Fields

Audit all forms and codebases for legacy or duplicate VAT fields and remove them.

Only reference the unified dropdown in all modules.

6. User Experience

Ensure all VAT dropdown fields are labeled and placed intuitively.

Show the selected VAT type on all generated invoices, estimates, and product lists.

Additional Notes:
The above improvements should not duplicate any existing product or VAT management logic.

All features must be mobile- and tablet-friendly.

Follow strict permission rules for user access to VAT setup and changes.

Summary:

One VAT group in the system.

One source for dropdown in every relevant module.

No duplicate or legacy VAT types.

Dropdown must be present in Product, Invoice, and Estimate creation.

Email must be configured and tested.

UX must be consistent and intuitive.

Multi-Business Accounting Platform: Final Launch-Readiness Implementation Checklist
Action Required:
Thoroughly review the entire platform for completeness and fill all remaining gaps, ensuring the following critical features and workflows are fully built, tested, and production-ready:

1. Integrated Online Subscription Payment & Billing
Fully implement a secure, real-time online payment system for subscription management using PayFast (for South Africa) or other supported gateways for global use.

Allow company administrators to:

Select and activate subscription plans.

Pay for new and renewing subscriptions online, with immediate activation or renewal upon successful payment.

View payment history, download receipts/invoices, and update payment methods.

Automatically receive email notifications for successful payments, failed transactions, upcoming renewals, and plan changes.

Ensure all subscription and payment activity is reflected instantly in both admin and super admin panels.

Automate subscription expiry logic—companies with failed or overdue payments must have feature restrictions as per their plan.

2. Self-Service Subscription Management
Provide a clear self-service portal for company admins to:

View their current plan, billing status, renewal date, and plan details.

Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions directly in the portal, with appropriate billing adjustments and proration.

Manage subscription add-ons or extra modules (if any).

3. Full Client Portal Capabilities
Enable a client portal for each company’s clients, providing access to:

View and download invoices.

Make payments (optional for AR extension).

Download statements and supporting documents.

Update contact details (if permitted by company settings).

4. Payroll and Fixed Asset Management
Ensure that full payroll functionality is available if included in the product scope, covering:

Employee and contractor payroll, PAYE, UIF, SDL, and payslip generation.

Provide a fixed asset register, with support for asset additions, depreciation, and disposals.

Both modules must be fully integrated into the accounting, reporting, and compliance workflows.

5. Recurring Billing and Workflow Automation
Support automated recurring transactions for invoices, expenses, and payroll, with customizable schedules and reminders.

Automate email or in-app reminders for upcoming, due, or overdue items.

6. Document Management
Allow users to attach, preview, and manage documents on transactions, clients, and companies, supporting drag-and-drop uploads and secure storage.

7. API and Integration Readiness
Provide secure API endpoints for third-party integration (POS, CRM, e-commerce, etc.).

Document and test all APIs, ensuring role-based access and security.

8. Notifications, Reminders, and Advanced Analytics
Deliver comprehensive in-app and email notifications for all important events (payments, renewals, reminders, compliance deadlines).

Offer advanced analytics dashboards with real-time business insights, customizable widgets, and downloadable reports.

9. Mobile Responsiveness and Cross-Platform Access
Ensure the entire platform is fully mobile responsive and functions seamlessly on tablets and smartphones.

Test and optimize all flows for mobile devices.

10. Globalization, White-Label, and Scalability
Prepare for multi-currency, multi-language, and white-labeling capabilities if required by your business model.

Confirm that the system architecture supports scalable user and data growth.

11. Security, Compliance, and Data Isolation
Finalize all audit trails, security permissions, and data isolation protocols.

Conduct a security and privacy review for user data, payment data, and company information.

12. User Experience Review
Review all forms, dashboards, company switchers, and onboarding flows for clarity, consistency, and ease of use.

Ensure every workflow matches or exceeds the standards of Zoho Books, QuickBooks, and leading SaaS products.

Deliverable:
A system that is fully production-ready, secure, and feature-complete—enabling accountants, businesses, and clients to manage all aspects of multi-company accounting, billing, compliance, and user experience to the highest global standards.

No additional sample prompts or code are required. All the above points must be confirmed complete, working, and ready for go-live.

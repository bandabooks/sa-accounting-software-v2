1. Scan the codebase for all references to `create`, `edit`, and similar page actions (e.g., `/create`, `/edit`, `/new`, `/update`, etc.) in the routing configuration (such as React Router, Vue Router, or your framework's router).

2. For each route:
    a. Check if the page/component is correctly registered in the router (e.g., `routes.js`, `App.js`, `Router.tsx`, or your main router file).
    b. Ensure the path, component, and import statements are all correct and have not been renamed, moved, or deleted.
    c. Verify there are no typos or case sensitivity issues in route paths or component names.

3. For each button, link, or navigation that triggers a "create", "edit", or similar action:
    a. Confirm the navigation (e.g., `navigate()`, `<Link>`, `history.push`) matches a registered route.
    b. If using dynamic route parameters (e.g., `/create?id=1`, `/edit/:id`), ensure parameter handling is consistent and the component can handle both creation and editing as intended.

4. Test all create, edit, and related actions from the UI.
    a. If any action results in a 404 error, output the route that failed and why (e.g., missing from router, component import error, file not found, etc.).
    b. Suggest immediate fixes (e.g., add the route to the router, correct the component import, fix navigation path, etc.).

5. Add a **preventive check** in your deployment or build scripts to automatically scan for missing routes/components for all common CRUD actions.
    - If any are missing, output a warning and fail the build until resolved.

6. Ensure any recent merges or rollbacks did not overwrite or remove route/component registrations. Run a diff check on router files.

7. After implementing fixes, re-test all actions to confirm that no "404 Page Not Found" appears for any valid create, edit, or CRUD action.

**Summary:**  
Automate the detection of missing or broken routes (especially create/edit) by verifying router registration, navigation links, and component presence. Prevent any 404 errors by running this check before every deployment or feature push.

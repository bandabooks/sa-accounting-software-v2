Here’s a crisp blueprint for how your business/accounting dashboard should look and work based on the screenshot:

Quick takeaways

Good content set (cash, AR/AP, tasks, bank rec, recent activity) but hierarchy feels flat and activity list dominates.

KPIs don’t roll up into a single “health” view; trends are fragmented.

Actions (“New Invoice”, “Add Customer”, “VAT Return”) are far from the data they affect.

No global time range or company filter controlling all cards.

Visual noise: mixed chip styles, small typography, uneven spacing, and low contrast on secondaries.

Recommended structure (top → bottom)

Global controls bar: Company switcher • Time range (Today / 7 / 30 / Custom) • Search • Last sync/updated status.

KPI strip (6 cards max) — each with delta vs previous period and click-through:

Cash on hand

Net cash flow (period)

Receivables (and % overdue)

Payables (and due this week)

Unreconciled bank lines

Compliance tasks due (VAT/returns)

Primary chart row

Cash flow over time (area + bars: inflow/outflow; toggle MTD/QTD/YTD).

AR/AP aging (stacked bars or heatmap; quick filters for Overdue/This week).

Work queue

Tasks & alerts (due today/this week; approvals, missing docs, failed bank syncs).

Bank reconciliation progress (per account with CTA “Continue reconciling”).

Money-in-motion

Recent transactions (exception-first: uncategorized, duplicates, large).

Invoices (drafts, pending, overdue with “Send/Remind/Record payment” inline).

Clients & revenue (if multi-client/practice)

Small table: top clients by outstanding, new customers added.

Quick actions (sticky at right or bottom)

New invoice • Record payment • Add expense • VAT return • Import/Sync bank.

Design system notes

12-column grid, clear spacing scale (8/16/24).

Typography: 18–20px page title, 14–16px body, 12–13px meta.

Color: green for positive deltas, red for negatives; keep chips to 2 styles max.

Accessibility: AA contrast, focus states, keyboard nav.

Empty/error states with next-best action.

Goal
Refactor the Bill form so it mirrors the Expense form structure: 
- Basic Details tab with GL allocations (no quantity).
- Line Items tab for catalog items (with quantity).
- Remove illogical mixing (e.g., quantity on GL accounts).

Changes

1) Bill Details (Header)
- Fields: Supplier, Bill Date, Due Date, Reference/Invoice No, Notes.
- Expense Allocations (same as Expense form Basic Details):
  - Columns: Description, GL Account (dropdown), VAT Code, Amount (Incl/Excl).
  - NO Quantity/Unit Price on GL accounts.
  - Disallow control accounts (Bank, A/P, A/R, VAT control) in GL dropdown.

2) Line Items (Catalog Tab)
- Reuse the same Line Item component from the Expense form (not Invoice).
- Item source = Products/Services catalog with default GL + VAT mappings.
- Columns: Item, Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Discount, VAT Code, Line Total.
- Posting:
  - Inventory items → Inventory GL (or COGS if Immediate Consumption = ON).
  - Service items → Expense GL.
  - Asset items → Fixed Asset GL.

3) Totals & VAT
- Subtotal = Expense Allocations + Line Items (net).
- VAT Total = sum of line VAT.
- Gross Total = Subtotal + VAT.
- Auto-calculate, do not allow VAT control account as line.

4) Posting (unchanged A/P logic)
- On Save Bill:
  Dr Expense/COGS/Inventory/Assets (per line net)
  Dr Input VAT
  Cr Accounts Payable (gross)
- Bill status = UNPAID until Payment (Dr A/P, Cr Bank).

5) Validation
- If user enters Quantity/Unit Price in GL allocation → block.
- If control GL is selected in allocation → block.
- If item line is Inventory and Immediate Consumption OFF → post to Inventory; if ON → post to COGS.

6) API/Model
- Bill payload:
  - basicDetails: supplierId, billDate, dueDate, ref, notes
  - expenseAllocations[]: { description, glAccountId, vatCode, amount }
  - lineItems[]: { itemId, description, qty, unitPrice, discount?, vatCode, immediateConsumption? }
- Compute totals server-side.

7) UI
- Tabs: Basic Details | Line Items | Recurring Options
- Same user experience as “Add New Expense”.

Go-Live Final Testing Checklist & Prompt
Please execute the following final tests and verifications to ensure the system is 100% production-ready:

1. Sign-Up & Onboarding Flow
Test the full user sign-up workflow (as a brand new user):

Complete onboarding fields (name, email, company, password, etc).

Ensure after account creation, user is redirected to the login page with a clear success message (“Account created, please log in”).

Verify new user can successfully log in with the credentials they set up.

Test edge cases: leave required fields blank, use duplicate emails, etc.—make sure proper validation and feedback are provided.

2. Login Flow
Confirm the login form works for both username and email.

Invalid login credentials display appropriate errors (not blank pages).

Successful login always redirects to the main dashboard.

Session/cookie handling: after logout, user cannot access authenticated pages.

3. Navigation & Page Rendering
Click through every sidebar and menu item (dashboard, sales, reports, chart of accounts, settings, etc.).

Verify no page renders as blank/white under any condition. If a route or permission is missing, display a friendly error or “not found” message.

Check page responsiveness across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

4. Core Module Functionality
Test all main modules for correct data flow:

Create new invoices, expenses, customers, suppliers, products, etc.

Make sure all data saves and displays as expected.

Confirm all financial transactions correctly update the Chart of Accounts.

Test real business transactions (e.g., invoice payment, bank posting).

5. Error & Exception Handling
Force some errors (bad URLs, expired sessions, unauthorized access) to confirm no white screens appear—always show a controlled, professional error message.

Test with missing or invalid data in forms.

6. Email & Notification Delivery
Confirm account activation, password reset, and notification emails are sent/received (if implemented).

7. Performance & Security
Pages load quickly, no unhandled errors in browser console.

Sensitive routes are protected (can’t access as an unauthenticated user).

8. Visual QA
All branding, buttons, menus, and forms render correctly and professionally.

No misaligned or overflowing components.

All content is spell-checked and professional.

Prompt for Final UAT (User Acceptance Testing) & Go-Live Readiness
Final Pre-Go-Live QA Checklist

Test the complete sign-up, onboarding, and login workflow end-to-end.

Confirm all navigation/menu items load pages with no blank/white screens under any condition.

Validate that every transaction updates the Chart of Accounts and other reports in real time.

Check for any UI glitches, typos, or non-professional error messages.

Ensure after sign-up, the user is redirected to the login page with a confirmation message.

Verify no module or page can be accessed by an unauthenticated user.

Ensure that logging out always redirects to the login page and clears session.

Confirm there are no blank screens or missing content anywhere in the app.

Report and fix any issues immediately. Only mark Go-Live ready when all above checks are passed.

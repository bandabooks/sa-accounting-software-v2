Error 500: {"message":"Failed to create session"}
along with repeated "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)" on the /api/bulk-capture/sessions endpoint means that bulk income and expense transactions are NOT being recorded in the database. This is a backend/server error, not a front-end bug.

Root Causes (Likely)
API/Backend is failing to process and save the transaction (server-side code is not handling the POST request).

The endpoint /api/bulk-capture/sessions is either:

Not implemented

Throws an error (e.g., missing required fields, database connection, code bug)

Permissions/roles not set up correctly

Database migrations not up to date for new tables/fields

Edit
The current implementation of the Bulk Income and Bulk Expense Capture modules is failing to save transactions to the database. When attempting to save, a 500 Internal Server Error occurs from the `/api/bulk-capture/sessions` endpoint, and no transactions are recorded. 

**Implementation Rules:**
- First **VERIFY** that the `/api/bulk-capture/sessions` endpoint exists and is properly implemented in the backend.
- CHECK for required fields or data validation errors that might be causing the endpoint to throw an error.
- INSPECT server logs for detailed error output and resolve any code exceptions or database issues.
- ENSURE the database schema/migrations for bulk capture features are up-to-date.
- CONFIRM that permissions and roles allow bulk capture actions for the current user.
- TEST the endpoint with sample data using Postman or similar tools to confirm it returns a 200 OK and successfully inserts records.
- Once fixed, confirm that:
  - Submissions from the UI save records in the DB
  - Bulk entries reflect immediately in general/journal entries and standard reports (integration, not just separate storage).
- DO NOT duplicate business logic—ensure this uses the same posting logic as individual entries/invoices.

**Notes:**  
- This feature must be seamless and robust.  
- Ensure all error handling and user feedback are in place for failed or partial submissions.
Instructions for You/Your Developer
Check the API Route:

Make sure /api/bulk-capture/sessions is implemented and mapped to a valid controller/function.

Check Server Logs:

Get the actual error from the backend logs to pinpoint if it’s a database issue, validation, missing parameter, or code bug.

Validate Data:

Make sure all required fields are being sent (e.g., dates, account IDs, descriptions, amounts, etc.).

Database Migrations:

Run migrations/updates to ensure tables and columns for bulk capture exist.

Test API Directly:

Use a tool like Postman to POST sample data directly and see if the error still occurs.

If it works in Postman but not UI, check the front-end data structure.

Permissions:

Confirm the logged-in user has the correct permissions/roles for bulk capture.

Error Handling:

Update the UI to show clear error messages if the backend fails, not just a generic toast.

Summary
The error is backend/server-related (500 Internal Server Error).

Transactions are not saved—must be fixed in backend API.

Use the above prompt to guide your developer or AI agent.

Once backend is fixed, bulk entries should save and reflect everywhere in the system.

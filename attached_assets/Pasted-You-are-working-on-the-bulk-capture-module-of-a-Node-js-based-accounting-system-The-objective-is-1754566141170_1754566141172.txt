You are working on the `/bulk-capture` module of a Node.js-based accounting system. The objective is to provide a **real-time display unit or counter** that shows the **number of transactions captured (both Draft and Finalized)**, without needing to navigate to the General Entries module.

---

### 🎯 GOAL:
- Add a **visible counter or display card** on the Bulk Capture screen.
- Show the **number of transactions captured to date** within the current company context.
- Clearly indicate:
  - ✅ Number of Finalized Entries
  - 📝 Number of Draft Entries
  - 📊 Total Number of Entries Today

---

### 📋 REQUIREMENTS:

#### 1. 🖼️ **Transaction Counter Display**
- Add a summary display bar at the top or right-side panel of the `/bulk-capture` page.
- Display:
  - `Total Transactions Captured Today: X`
  - `Finalized: Y`
  - `Draft: Z`
- Use styled badges, chips, or cards to display counts with the following colors:
  - Green for Finalized
  - Yellow for Draft
  - Gray or Blue for Total

#### 2. 🔁 **Live Mirror Without Page Refresh**
- Counter should **update instantly** when a new transaction is saved or finalized.
- Use WebSocket or local state + real-time update via React/JS.
- No need to navigate to `/general-entries` to fetch counts.

#### 3. 🧠 **Filters (Optional Enhancement)**
- Add filter toggles: `Today`, `This Week`, `This Month` for better insight.
- Clicking on the count opens a filtered view (optional).

### ⚙️ TECH INSTRUCTIONS:
- Fetch records from the `journal_entries` or `bulk_entries` table filtered by:
  - Logged-in company
  - Current date (`created_at`)
- Use count aggregation grouped by `status = 'finalized'` or `status = 'draft'`
- Display counts in the UI using a card or badge component with animated count-up if possible

### ✅ UI Example (Suggested Layout)

```jsx
<Card title="Bulk Capture Summary">
  <Badge color="gray">Total Today: 24</Badge>
  <Badge color="green">Finalized: 18</Badge>
  <Badge color="yellow">Draft: 6</Badge>
</Card>

A. QA Checklist for Enterprise Feature Validation
Use this checklist for thorough testing of all enterprise features before launch.

1. Security (2FA)
 User can enroll in 2FA using Google/Microsoft Authenticator (QR code).

 Backup codes are generated, downloadable, and work for login.

 2FA enforcement works for required roles (admin, accountant, etc.).

 2FA reset/recovery process is functional and secure.

 User is clearly notified about 2FA status and enforcement.

 All login attempts (including 2FA) are logged and viewable in audit log.

2. OAuth (Google/Microsoft SSO)
 User can log in with Google/Microsoft account.

 OAuth login is possible on both desktop and mobile.

 Users can link/unlink OAuth accounts in enterprise settings.

 Token revocation/disconnection works as expected.

3. Notification Management
 Users receive email/SMS notifications for all critical events (2FA, security alerts, reminders, invoices, system updates).

 Notification preferences are editable per user.

 Test notification button sends a preview to the user.

 Notification delivery is reliable (no duplicates or missing alerts).

4. AI Assistant (Chat Component)
 AI assistant responds contextually to business/accounting queries.

 No cross-company data is leaked in AI conversations.

 AI assistant can be enabled/disabled by user/company.

 User can control sharing of sensitive data with AI.

 Conversational UI works on both desktop and mobile.

5. Enterprise Settings Page
 All enterprise features (security, notifications, AI, OAuth) are accessible in one settings page.

 Only authorized roles (super admin, company admin) can edit enterprise settings.

 Changes persist after save and across devices.

 Role-based access control is enforced for enterprise features.

 All settings have clear descriptions/help text.

6. Navigation/Responsiveness
 Enterprise settings are easy to find in both sidebar and mobile navigation.

 UI is responsive and all features are usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

7. Audit Logging
 All security-sensitive changes (2FA, OAuth, notification settings) are logged.

 Audit log is viewable by super admin and company admin.

B. UI and UX Enhancement Suggestions
Improvements to maximize usability, professionalism, and user delight:

1. UI Enhancements
Grouped Tabs:
Group security, notifications, AI, and OAuth into tabs or accordion panels for clarity.

Status Indicators:
Show real-time status for features (e.g., “2FA enabled”, “OAuth linked”, “AI active”).

Use animated “toast” notifications for saves, errors, and important actions.

Test/Preview Buttons:
Provide “Send test notification” or “Preview AI reply” buttons.

Profile Avatar & Brand Logo:
Allow custom company branding and user avatars in header/side menu.

2. UX Enhancements
Onboarding Flows:
Guided onboarding for enterprise features (first-time 2FA, AI assistant intro, notification setup).

Progress Indicators:
Show step-by-step progress (e.g., for 2FA setup).

Smart Tooltips & Help Links:
Add contextual tooltips and “learn more” links for advanced settings.

Accessibility:
Keyboard navigation, high-contrast mode, and ARIA labels for all forms.

Mobile Gestures:
Swipe-to-navigate or tap-and-hold for quick actions on mobile.

Include a visible “Activity History” or “Audit Log” in the enterprise settings area.

3. Delight Features

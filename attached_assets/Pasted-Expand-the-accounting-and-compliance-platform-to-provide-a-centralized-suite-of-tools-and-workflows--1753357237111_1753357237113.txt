Compliance Document Management:

Central document vault for each client/company, categorized by compliance type (SARS, CIPC, labor).

Full search, tagging, version history, and secure access controls.

Automated Workflow & Task Management:

Provide task assignment, delegation, tracking, and automated reminders for all compliance and client management actions.

Ensure all tasks link to client, deadline, and responsible staff member, with real-time status updates and audit trails.

Integrated Billing, Payments, and Point of Sale:

Support recurring invoices, receipts, direct payment links, and POS integration.

Automate reconciliation with bank feeds.

All financial activity to sync with the accounting ledger and compliance reporting.

AI & Automation:

Integrate AI-powered assistants to guide users in compliance, automate reminders, help draft letters, and answer regulatory questions.

Use AI to suggest workflow optimizations and detect missing compliance steps.

Role-Based Access, Security, and Reporting:

Ensure secure, audit-trailed access per user/role/client.

Provide customizable dashboards and reports for compliance, deadlines, workflow status, financials, and audits.

Extensibility and Scalability:

Architect the system to allow future integration with HR, CRM, e-commerce, and additional government APIs.

Revamp User Roles, Permissions, and Module Access in Super Admin Panel
Current Issues to Fix:

User roles dropdown is limited (shows only 4, not customizable, not reflecting a full accounting environment)

Demo users are inappropriately assigned as Super Admin (major security risk)

Permissions are NOT granular or mapped to real system modules

No ability to add new roles, customize roles, or define module access

Permissions UI does not show real, assignable module permissions or reflect system changes

No unified roles/permissions structure across the system (not blending with accounting modules)

No page for activating/deactivating system modules per company/account

Lacks audit trails for permission changes

Requirements for a Robust Roles & Permissions System
Full Role List & Management:

Show all standard roles relevant for an accounting/business suite (e.g., Super Admin, Admin, Accountant, Bookkeeper, Auditor, Payroll Admin, POS Operator, Sales, Purchases, Inventory Manager, HR, etc.)

Allow creation of custom roles (with name, description, and selected permissions)

Assign default roles only to legitimate real users, NEVER to demo/test users

Module & Feature Permissions:

List ALL available system modules/features in a permissions matrix/grid

Examples: Dashboard, Chart of Accounts, Sales, Invoicing, Purchases, Bills, Suppliers, Payments, Inventory, VAT, Compliance, Reports, Payroll, HR, POS, System Settings, User Management, API Integrations, etc.

Allow per-role and per-user assignment of permissions (View, Create, Edit, Delete, Approve, Export, Manage, Configure, etc.)

Allow module activation/deactivation per company/account for multi-tenant SaaS use

Role Assignment & Security:

Show a list of all users with columns: Username, Email, Role, Status, Last Login, Actions (Manage, Edit, Deactivate, Delete, Set Permissions)

Assign users only to roles they are permitted for (no demo/test users as Super Admins)

Super Admin role can access everything, but only one or a few legitimate users should have this

Permissions UI/UX:

Clean, modern permissions matrix/table: all modules listed in rows, permission types in columns, checkboxes/toggles per role

Easy to bulk-assign or revoke permissions

View/assign permissions per role or per user

Ability to clone/copy roles and their permissions

Audit & Transparency:

Log all changes to roles and permissions with timestamps, user, and action

Optional: allow export of roles/permissions for compliance/audit

Integration with System:

Role and permission logic enforced across all system pages, APIs, and features

Permissions determine visibility and access throughout the UI and backend

Module Activation Page:

Dedicated page in Super Admin/Settings: activate/deactivate modules per company/account (with a toggle for each module)

Only show modules in user navigation/menu if active for their company

Example UI Flows
Manage Users: List, Add, Edit, Assign Role, Set Permissions, Activate/Deactivate, Delete

Manage Roles: List, Add, Edit, Copy, Delete, Assign Permissions

Permissions Matrix: [Role/User] x [Module/Feature] x [Permission Type]

Module Activation: List of modules with activation toggles per company

Summary Prompt for Implementation:
Redesign the Super Admin/User Management panel to support full-featured, secure user roles and permissions management for the accounting/business system. Include:

All industry-standard roles, ability to add/edit/delete/custom roles

Comprehensive permissions matrix (all modules, CRUD actions)

Assign roles and permissions per user

Activate/deactivate modules per company

Audit logging for all changes

Ensure no demo/test users are assigned as Super Admin

UI must be modern, intuitive, and reflect true system structureâ€”not a stand-alone module

Permissions must be enforced across all system features, navigation, and data access

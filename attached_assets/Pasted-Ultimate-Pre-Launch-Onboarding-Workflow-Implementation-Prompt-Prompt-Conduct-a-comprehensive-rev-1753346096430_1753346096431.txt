Ultimate Pre-Launch Onboarding & Workflow Implementation Prompt
Prompt:

Conduct a comprehensive review and verification of the entire onboarding process and end-to-end accounting workflow within the platform.

Requirements:

Onboarding Process

Confirm the presence of a complete, seamless onboarding workflow for new companies and users—including company creation, industry selection, chart of accounts setup, VAT configuration, subscription package selection, and user assignment.

Ensure onboarding steps are clear, error-free, and fully integrated, with all required fields and initial setup actions.

No demo or placeholder data should exist; system must be ready to accept live data.

Core Accounting Modules

Validate the implementation and integration of all essential modules: Invoicing, Clients/Customers, Products & Services, Purchases, Suppliers, Expenses, Banking, VAT, Chart of Accounts, and General Ledger.

For each module, verify that all standard features found in Sage, QuickBooks, and Zoho are present and working:

Invoice Module: Recurring invoices, credit notes, payment tracking, invoice aging, automated reminders, PDF/email delivery, partial payments, VAT integration, and reporting to sales accounts.

Purchase Module: Supplier management, purchase orders, bills, expense categorization, payment tracking, approval workflows, and VAT capture.

Clients/Customers: Aging reports, statements, credit limits, transaction history.

Products & Services: Inventory management, service tracking, automatic stock updates on sales/purchases, price lists.

Banking: Bank feed integration (for South Africa: Yoco, Stitch, Nedbank, FNB, ABSA, Standard Bank, etc.), reconciliation, and automatic transaction matching.

VAT Module: Registration toggle, default VAT types, VAT fields in all relevant modules, correct VAT reporting, and VAT201 ready for SARS compliance.

Chart of Accounts & GL: Default accounts per industry, customizable, account activation/deactivation, automated posting from all modules.

Workflow Integration

Confirm that all modules are fully integrated:

Invoices and purchases update bank balances and respective GL accounts automatically.

VAT is calculated and posted correctly based on company registration status.

Payments received, expenses paid, and other transactions are instantly reflected in balances and reports.

Reporting

Ensure all core reports are present and accurate: Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss, Cash Flow, VAT201, Customer & Supplier Aging, General Ledger, and Trial Balance.

Reports must pull from live data and update in real time as transactions occur.

Bank Integration

Verify live integration with major South African bank APIs and/or upload features for bank statements.

Test auto-reconciliation and transaction matching for accuracy.

Final System Readiness

The system must be ready for production with no demo, mock-up, or placeholder data.

All modules must support role-based access and secure, isolated multi-company operation.

All forms, flows, and modules must be responsive, professional, and production-ready—immediately able to serve accountants, business owners, and their teams.

Feature Checklist and Gap Resolution

For each workflow and module, list all implemented features.

If any required feature is missing, incomplete, or not fully integrated, proceed to implement it now to ensure 100% functional parity with Sage, QuickBooks, and Zoho.

Goal:
Deliver a 100% complete, fully integrated, and production-ready accounting SaaS system with professional onboarding and A–Z accounting workflows—ready for live business use and client onboarding.

Task: Normalize and fix System Roles hierarchy (remove duplicates, correct levels, update seeds/UI).

Goals
1) Enforce a single, consistent RBAC ladder from Level 10 (highest) to Level 1 (lowest).
2) Remove duplicate roles (there must be only ONE “Sales Representative”).
3) Ensure Company Admin is below System Admin. The subscription-paying platform owner remains top.
4) Update database seeds/migrations and UI labels to match the new mapping.

Authoritative Role Mapping (use exactly these names, levels, and descriptions)
- Super Administrator — Level 10
  Platform & subscription owner. Global access to all companies, billing, plans, platform settings.
- System Administrator — Level 9
  System/integrations/configuration. No subscription billing authority.
- Company Administrator — Level 8
  Full control within their company (users, roles, company billing, settings).
- Company Owner — Level 7
  Operational owner for a single company; full day-to-day business control.
- Accountant — Level 6
  Core accounting: invoicing, expenses, journals, bank rec, VAT; can edit financial data.
- Manager — Level 6
  Department/business unit scope. Approvals, reports, limited edits.
- Bookkeeper — Level 5
  Daily entries: sales, expenses, receipts, bills. Limited reporting.
- Payroll Administrator — Level 5
  Payroll/HR: employees, leave, salaries. No sales/supplier data.
- Compliance Officer — Level 5
  Compliance modules (SARS, CIPC, Labour, VAT). Submit/track filings.
- Auditor — Level 4
  Read-only; can run/export reports, view logs. No edits.
- Sales Representative — Level 3
  Sales/customer modules (customers, quotes, invoices, products). Limited reporting.
- Cashier — Level 2
  POS only; process sales/print receipts. No back-office access.
- Employee — Level 2
  Only modules needed for tasks (POS, timesheets, tasks). No financial access.
- Viewer — Level 1
  View-only dashboards/reports. No management or edits.

Required Changes
- Create a DB migration that:
  a) Updates existing role records to the exact mapping above (names, levels, descriptions).
  b) Merges duplicate “Sales Representative” roles into a single record at Level 3, reassigning users to the surviving ID; remove the duplicate.
  c) Adds UNIQUE constraint on role name (case-insensitive).
  d) Optionally add a CHECK constraint that role_level BETWEEN 1 AND 10.
- Update seed script to insert the mapping above idempotently (upsert by name).
- Update any RBAC policy code to use numeric comparison (higher level = more privilege).
- Update the System Roles UI list to display the new order (desc by level), with counts preserved after merges.
- Ensure any references (enums/constants) match the new names exactly.

Acceptance Criteria
- No duplicate role names in DB; “Sales Representative” exists once at Level 3.
- Company Administrator shows Level 8; System Administrator shows Level 9.
- Super Administrator remains Level 10 and retains subscription/billing control.
- UI shows roles sorted 10→1 with the exact titles/levels/descriptions above.
- All existing users retain access; users from deleted duplicate roles are mapped to the surviving role.
- Seeds are safe to re-run (no duplicates).

Please implement migration, seeds, and UI updates accordingly, then run tests/verification to confirm the hierarchy and user counts.

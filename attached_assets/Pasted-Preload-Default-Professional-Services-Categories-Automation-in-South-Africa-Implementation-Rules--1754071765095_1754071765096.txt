Preload Default Professional Services, Categories & Automation in South Africa
Implementation Rules:
First VERIFY if each sub-feature exists before implementing.

If missing, create and integrate it seamlessly into existing service, product, and project/task structure.

DO NOT duplicate service or category logic—extend or reuse where possible.

Ensure all features are mobile and tablet friendly.

Respect user roles, permissions, and package/module switches.

Prompt:
1. Preload Default Professional Services for South Africa
Build a comprehensive master list of professional services offered by accountants, tax practitioners, auditors, business consultants, payroll practitioners, and related professionals in South Africa.

Include at least the most common 33 services—see below for initial list.

For each service, preload the following fields:

Service Name

Description

Suggested Retail Price (editable)

Default Service Category

Frequency/Periodicity (e.g., Monthly, Bi-Monthly, Quarterly, Annual, Once-off)

Linked Deadlines & Compliance Dates (auto-calculate for SARS/CIPC, e.g., VAT bi-monthly, Provisional Tax twice yearly, CIPC Annual Returns, etc.)

Linked Task/Project Template (when the service is selected, it auto-generates a standard project/task with default deadlines, reminders, and steps)

Linked Authority (SARS, CIPC, DOL, UIF, COIDA, etc.)

Switch/Toggle to include/exclude this service in each package/module.

2. Preload Default Categories
Preload a master list of default service categories (e.g., Accounting, Tax, Payroll, Advisory, CIPC Services, Compliance, Audit, Secretarial, Other).

Preload default product categories (e.g., Office Supplies, Software, Hardware, Books, Training Materials, etc.)

Categories must be editable, but not deletable if used by system services/products.

3. Service Automation & Project Linking
Every default service must be linked to a task/project template.

When a service is added to a client, it must auto-create a project/task (with deadlines, steps, and reminders).

Deadlines and reminders must trigger based on regulatory timelines (e.g., VAT due on 25th every second month, EMP201 monthly, Provisional Tax Feb/Aug, CIPC returns annual, etc.).

Admins can edit the deadlines or steps, but the default template must be provided.

4. Suggested Pricing
Each service should have a suggested minimum and maximum price, based on market research or regulatory guidelines (editable by the user/firm).

5. Package/Module Management
Default services and categories must be available for switch on/off per module or subscription plan.

Admin can enable/disable (hide) default services and categories per company.

6. System Requirements
All default data should be preloaded on first setup/installation, and must not be overwritten on future updates unless not customized.

All features must be available and usable on both desktop and mobile/tablet.

User must be able to customize/add new services or categories, but system defaults should always be available for reference.

Remove the redundant, basic permissions management currently found under User Management in the main dashboard. Integrate and centralize ALL permission logic to the robust, feature-complete permission module found under Subscriptions/Super Admin.

Unify Permissions Control:

The advanced module in Super Admin (with plan-specific, role-based, and module permission settings) should become the single source of truth for permissions management across the system.

Remove/deprecate any other standalone or "lite" permission modules (such as the one in regular User Management).

Ensure Seamless Role Mapping:

When a user, admin, or company admin sets permissions for any role, it must reference and update the unified permissions logic, not two different systems.

Subscription/Plan Integration:

Module/feature toggles and role-permission settings under each subscription plan must flow directly to the user's access in the actual platform.

Changes to permissions in the plan editor should immediately reflect in role assignments and access for all users in that subscription.

UI/UX Alignment:

Use the same permission selection interface (the robust, dropdown-based one) everywhere permissions are setâ€”no duplicate or simplified versions.

Ensure that when managing permissions from the User Management panel, it opens the same module (perhaps via a modal, drawer, or direct link) as in Super Admin.

Eliminate Conflicts and Bugs:

After migration, test thoroughly to ensure that there are no leftover endpoints, database tables, or logic from the removed, old permission management system.

Make sure toggling permissions works instantly and reliably everywhere, with proper feedback.

Single Source of Truth (SSOT):

Permissions should be stored and updated in one table or schema only, so that any UI change or API call stays perfectly in sync.

Summary to Developers:
Centralize all permission logic in the robust Super Admin/SaaS subscription module.

Remove all other permission managers and ensure only one way to assign, edit, or revoke permissions per role or module.

Link User Management > Permissions directly to the unified manager.

Test thoroughly for conflicts and edge cases after migration.

Prompt for ReplyDesk / Replit AI: User, Roles, Permissions & Modules – Unified Enhancement

Objective:
Unify, simplify, and modernize the user management, roles, permissions, and module activation system. Align the logic and experience with market standards (QuickBooks, Zoho, Sage, Xero). All features must be well integrated, intuitive, and 100% functional.

Key Enhancements:

Set Industry-Standard Default Permissions for Roles

Ensure each default system role (Super Admin, System Admin, Company Admin, Company Owner, Accountant, Payroll Admin, Manager, Bookkeeper, Compliance Officer, Auditor, Sales Rep, etc.) gets the correct set of permissions on all modules based on real-world job responsibilities.

Example:

Company Admin: All permissions on all modules within their company.

Accountant: Full access to financial, reporting, VAT, compliance, invoicing, but not system/user settings.

Bookkeeper: Data entry and edit access to transactions, invoices, expenses. No delete or system config.

Manager: View and manage team, see dashboards/reports relevant to department.

Implement as a default mapping, editable by super admins only.

Fix Module Toggles & Action Toggles

All toggle switches for module access and user actions (activation/deactivation) must be interactive and immediately reflect changes in the UI and backend.

Fix any “frozen” toggles on Module Access Control and User Directory.

Ensure proper API calls and feedback (success, error) for every toggle.

Subscription Plans: Default Module Activation

Define for each plan (“Basic,” “Professional,” “Enterprise,” etc.) which modules are available and which are activated by default.

Example:

Basic Plan: Dashboard, Invoicing, Customer Database, Basic Reports, Expense Management.

Professional Plan: Everything in Basic, plus Inventory, Purchase Orders, Financial Reports, VAT, Payroll, POS.

Enterprise Plan: All modules, incl. Multi-Company, API, Advanced Analytics, Custom Integrations.

When a new company subscribes or plan is upgraded/downgraded, the correct modules are activated/deactivated automatically.

Centralized & Streamlined UI

Merge redundant pages: There should be one “User Management” dashboard for users, roles, permissions, and module access.

“Permissions Matrix” should live inside the main User Management area as a tab.

“Module Activation” should also be a tab or embedded section — not a separate menu.

Role and permission management should always display the current, accurate mapping.

Audit & Duplication Safeguards

Prevent creation of duplicate roles (e.g., multiple “System Admin” or “Super Admin” system roles).

When system detects duplicate admin roles, prompt for review and merge or remove extras, with audit logs.

Optionally, run a migration script to audit, merge, and clean up existing roles/users if duplicates are found.

Role Assignment

When a new user is added, assign a sensible default role based on inviter’s permissions or admin setup.

When a new plan or company is created, assign the minimum necessary admin users only.

UX Consistency

All role/permission/module controls should use modern, accessible toggles and dropdowns — never require manual JSON edits.

Provide tooltips/help popovers for each permission and module for clarity.

Module Dependencies

If a plan includes modules with dependencies (e.g., Inventory requires Products), ensure all required modules are activated together.

Instructions:

Enhance existing modules and pages; do not create redundant or disconnected modules.

Apply all enhancements within the current unified user/role/module system.

If a feature is missing, implement it as described. If it exists but is scattered, consolidate.

Test the flow for adding/removing users, changing roles, activating/deactivating modules, and updating subscription plans to ensure end-to-end integrity.

Run an audit for duplicate roles/admins, and clean up as needed.

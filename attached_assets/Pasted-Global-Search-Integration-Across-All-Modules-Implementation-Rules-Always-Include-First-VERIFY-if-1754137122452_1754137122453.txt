Global Search Integration Across All Modules
Implementation Rules (Always Include):

First VERIFY if a global search bar feature already exists before implementing.

If missing, create and integrate it seamlessly into the existing UI structure (header or navigation).

DO NOT duplicate any global search logic.

Ensure search works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Respect user roles, permissions, and module access at all times.

Prompt
Please verify if a global search bar (universal search) is already available and active across all main pages and modules in the system.

The search bar should be clearly accessible in the main header, navigation bar, or sidebar, and visible at all times regardless of which module the user is currently in.

If a global search is not available:

Implement a single, centralized global search component:

Place it in the system’s main header or persistent sidebar (not duplicated in module UIs).

The search should be immediately accessible after login, on every page.

The search bar must:

Allow searching across all key records and modules:

Customers, Suppliers, Invoices, Products/Inventory, Transactions, Contacts, Projects/Tasks, etc.

Return results grouped by type (e.g., show “Invoices” results, “Clients” results, etc.).

Show clickable result items with links to their detail pages.

Ensure mobile and tablet responsiveness—the search must be easy to access and use on all device sizes.

Search results and data access must respect user roles and permissions:

Only show data the current user is authorized to see, based on their assigned modules/roles.

Avoid any duplication of global search components or logic.

Test global search for speed, accuracy, and correct permissions across different user types.

Notes:

The global search should be scalable and performant (suggest using backend query optimization if large data).

Provide a shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+K or Command+K) for power users.

Document the feature and provide user tips on effective search use.

Financial Reports UI/UX Enhancement Prompt
Objective:
Redesign the financial reports module so that clicking any report (Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss, Cash Flow, Trial Balance, etc.) opens a dropdown or modal with the detailed content, rather than navigating to a new page. Remove any full-table views or page reloads; all report details must be accessible within the same view, ensuring a seamless, single-page user experience.

Key Requirements:
Dropdown/Modal Report View:

When a user clicks on any report (e.g., Balance Sheet), open a dropdown section or modal directly below or over the report card.

Display the report details inside this dropdown/modal in a readable, well-formatted manner.

Do not navigate away or open a new window/tab.

Remove Table/Tab Page:

Completely remove the detailed table or tab page that currently opens when a report is selected.

The table view of Balance Sheet or any report must not be available as a separate page.

Integrated Actions (Inside Modal/Dropdown):

Inside the dropdown or modal, provide clear action buttons for:

Print

Download as PDF

Send by Email

These actions should be easily accessible and not require leaving the current view.

Keep Navigation Simple:

The navigation (e.g., Back to Reports, filters) must remain fixed and intuitive.

After closing the dropdown/modal, the user should see the report summary list as before.

No Duplicate or Redundant Content:

Ensure there are no duplicate tables or unnecessary tabs.

The entire workflow should be seamless and contained on a single page.

User Flow Example:
User visits /financial-reports.

User sees cards for Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss, Cash Flow, Trial Balance.

User clicks Balance Sheet:

A dropdown/modal appears within the same page showing the details.

Options to print, download PDF, or email are available in the modal/dropdown.

User can close the dropdown/modal and select another report without navigating away.

Implementation Notes:
Use modals for compact screens, dropdowns/expandable sections for desktop.

All report rendering logic should work in the modal/dropdown, fetching up-to-date data.

Maintain a professional, clean UI consistent with the rest of the system.

Prompt for Developers:

“Refactor the /financial-reports page so that clicking on any report card (Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss, etc.) expands a dropdown or opens a modal within the same page. Display the full report content there, along with print, download PDF, and email actions. Remove the existing table/tabbed detail pages and ensure there’s no navigation away from the reports summary list. The user must always remain on the /financial-reports page, and all interactions happen in-place for a seamless user experience.”

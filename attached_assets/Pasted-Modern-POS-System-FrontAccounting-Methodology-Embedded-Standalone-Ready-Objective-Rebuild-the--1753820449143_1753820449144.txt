Modern POS System (FrontAccounting Methodology, Embedded & Standalone Ready)
Objective:
Rebuild the Point-of-Sale (POS) system within our business software using the proven methodologies and workflows of FrontAccounting, but deliver it with a modern, user-centric interface, real-time reporting, and seamless integration into our current chart of accounts and business flows.

Functional & Technical Requirements
Design & UX

Match the clarity, simplicity, and workflow sequence found in FrontAccounting’s POS, but with an upgraded, clean, mobile-friendly, and visually modern UI/UX.

Use the same design language as the rest of the platform for full cohesion.

All key functions must be accessible via keyboard shortcuts, barcode input, or touchscreen.

Core POS Features (as in FrontAccounting)

Sales Entry Screen: Fast product/item lookup (barcode or search), add/remove/edit line items, apply discounts, tax selection, and instant total calculation.

Multiple Payment Methods: Accept cash, card, voucher, and split payment.

Receipt Generation: Print and/or email receipts with full transaction details.

Customer Selection/Walk-In Mode: Option to assign to a registered customer or walk-in.

Price/Stock Lookup: Real-time stock check, automatic price list retrieval, and warning for out-of-stock.

Suspend/Resume Sales: Ability to park a sale and resume later.

Returns & Refunds: Simple process to handle returns, refunds, and exchange—directly linked to original sale and inventory adjustment.

Daily Z-Reports/X-Reports: Shift and end-of-day summaries, with reconciliation features for cash/float management.

Sales Register/Session Management: Log open/close shifts, record cash in/out, and full audit trail per cashier/session.

Integration

Chart of Accounts: All sales, payments, returns, and cash movements must be posted in real-time to the correct general ledger accounts (e.g., Sales Revenue, VAT Output, Cash, Card Receivables).

Inventory: Live integration with stock management; all sales instantly reduce inventory, and stock levels are visible at POS.

Customer Management: Sales link to customer accounts if selected, supporting credit sales or loyalty points where enabled.

Reporting: Instant access to POS-specific reports (sales by product, time, cashier, tender type, profitability, VAT summary, etc.).

User/Roles Integration: POS permissions and visibility managed through existing user/role management.

Deployment/Access

POS can be embedded as a module in the main app (with single-sign-on), but should also support a standalone POS-only plan for businesses needing only sales/register functionality.

Works offline-first with auto-sync when reconnected, if possible.

Modern Enhancements

Touch-optimized for tablet use.

Configurable layout (e.g., product buttons, grid/list view).

QR or barcode scanning for fast checkout.

Optional customer-facing display.

Support for promotions, loyalty, and coupons.

Real-time notifications/alerts for voids, refunds, large cashouts, or errors.

Integration hooks for future mobile payments (SnapScan, Yoco, etc.).

Acceptance Criteria
All FrontAccounting POS functions are available and improved for modern usability.

No duplicate sales or inventory records—POS must post directly to main ledgers and stock.

User experience is intuitive for experienced accountants and cashiers alike.

All POS reports reconcile with financial and business reports.

Full audit trail for every transaction and session.

Seamless integration with the rest of the platform (accounts, inventory, reporting).

Implementation Notes
Before building, review existing POS workflows in FrontAccounting for reference.

Ensure all account mappings and integration points are documented.

Do not create a duplicate POS module—enhance and refactor the existing one.

Design for global usability—tax, currency, and receipt formatting must be configurable.

Summary Prompt to Dev/AI Team
“Enhance our Point-of-Sale system using the proven workflows and integrity checks from FrontAccounting, but deliver it with a fully modern, fast, and professional UI/UX that integrates perfectly into our current platform. Ensure all features, account mappings, inventory updates, and reporting are robust, enterprise-grade, and user-friendly. POS must be accessible both as an embedded module and a standalone plan for clients who need only register functionality.”

“Download/Print PDF” is using a screenshot renderer, instead of generating a professional structured report. This applies to:

📊 Trial Balance

📈 Profit & Loss

📒 Balance Sheet

💵 Cash Flow

(and any other financial reports/charts).

Here’s the master prompt you can give your dev/agent so it fixes all reports in one go:

Prompt (Fix PDF Export for All Financial Reports)

Replace the current PDF export logic (which screenshots/prints the screen) with a true report generator.

Apply this change to Trial Balance, Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow.

The PDF must always render as a structured, professional document, not a screenshot.

General Requirements:

Header Section

Company Name

Report Title (e.g., “Trial Balance”)

Date Range / Period

Generated Date & Time

Table Layout

Columns must be properly aligned (not one merged column).

Use clear headers:

Trial Balance → Account Code | Account Name | Account Type | Debit | Credit

Profit & Loss → Account Code | Account Name | Category | Amount

Balance Sheet → Account Code | Account Name | Category | Amount

Cash Flow → Category | Inflows | Outflows | Net Movement

Totals row at bottom where applicable (e.g., Debit = Credit).

Format numbers with thousand separators and 2 decimal places.

Styling

Use professional fonts (sans-serif like Arial/Roboto).

Keep layout consistent across all reports.

Avoid clutter (no screenshots, no unnecessary UI elements).

Ensure all tables are page-break safe (do not cut rows mid-line).

Export Settings

File names should follow pattern:

Trial_Balance_<Company>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf

Profit_Loss_<Company>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf

Balance_Sheet_<Company>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf

Cash_Flow_<Company>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf

Each PDF must be printable and importable into Draftworx or similar accounting software.

No screenshots → real tabular data only.

⚡ Summary: All reports must export as true structured PDFs, with proper headers, aligned columns, and totals, just like the Excel export — not as UI screenshots.

SARS-compliant report logic:
✅ 1. Report Types to Implement
Break them into two categories:

A. SARS-Aligned Reports (Detailed submission-ready)
These follow the structure required by SARS for VAT201 or audit reviews.

SARS VAT Report (VAT201 View):

Output must include blocks A–Z

Fields: Output VAT, Input VAT, Adjustments, Imports/Exports, Fuel levy if applicable

Show submission period, entity name, VAT number, payment due date

Option to export PDF & XML (for manual SARS eFiling or archive)

Optional: Include “Reason for Adjustment” section if applicable.

VAT Reconciliation Report:

Cross-match source documents (invoices, purchases) with submitted blocks

Clearly indicate any unmatched or excluded items

Use highlighting or color indicators (✓ = matched, ! = mismatch)

VAT Audit Trail / Source Report:

All VAT entries: Invoice number, Customer/Vendor, Date, Amount, VAT code, VAT amount

Filters by:

Date range

VAT code

Document type (invoice, credit note, purchase, etc.)

Export: Excel, CSV, PDF

B. Business Summary Reports (QuickBooks-style)
For management view and financial clarity.

VAT Summary Report:

Shows Input vs Output VAT totals

Net VAT Payable/Refundable

Comparison graph: current period vs previous period

Breakdown by VAT codes (e.g., Standard, Zero-rated, Exempt)

Export: PDF, Excel

VAT Transaction Analysis Report:

Grouped by document type:

Sales Invoices

Credit Notes

Purchases

Expenses

Totals per type, plus drill-down capabilities

VAT Variance Report (Optional but powerful):

Compare expected VAT from turnover vs actual

Helps detect anomalies or missed transactions

✅ 2. VAT Period Handling
Based on your current implementation:

Fetch period config from VAT Settings

Dynamically map to:

js
Copy
Edit
const startDate = VAT_PERIODS[selectedPeriod].start;
const endDate = VAT_PERIODS[selectedPeriod].end;
Always validate:

Selected period must not be in the future

If current month is incomplete (e.g., August on 3rd), allow only up to July–August

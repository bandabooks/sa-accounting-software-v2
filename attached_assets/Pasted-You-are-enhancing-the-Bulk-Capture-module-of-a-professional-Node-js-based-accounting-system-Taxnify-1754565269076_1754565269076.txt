You are enhancing the Bulk Capture module of a professional Node.js-based accounting system (Taxnify) to ensure it supports **finalized financial data**, **clear draft distinction**, and **professional analytics**. This system is used by accountants and tax practitioners, and must uphold data integrity for audits and accurate reporting.

---

### 📌 MODULE: Bulk Capture (Income & Expense)
Location: `/bulk-capture`

---

### ✅ OBJECTIVE:

1. **Allow capturing of multiple income/expense entries**
2. **Ensure distinction between "Draft" and "Finalized" entries**
3. **Visibly confirm saved entries**
4. **Display professional metrics for better review and audit**

---

### 📋 FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

#### 1. 🚦**Draft vs Finalized Status**
- On saving, users **must choose**:
  - `Save as Draft` — Entry saved but **not posted** to general ledger
  - `Finalize and Post` — Entry saved and **posted to general ledger**
- Each row should display status icon: 📝 Draft or ✅ Finalized
- Finalized entries are **locked** from editing unless reopened by admin

---

#### 2. ✅ **User Feedback and Confirmation**
- When finalized: Show message like:
  > ✅ **Success! 5 transactions were recorded and posted to the ledger.**
- When saved as draft: Show:
  > 💾 **Saved as Draft. Entries will not affect reports until finalized.**

---

#### 3. 📊 **Capture Metrics Summary Panel**
- Add a right-side or top summary box with metrics:
  - 📅 **Today**:  X finalized, Y draft
  - 📆 **Yesterday**: X finalized
  - 📈 **This Month**: Total X entries, Z finalized
  - 🧾 Total recorded value: Rxx,xxx.00
  - 📌 % Finalized: e.g., 87%

**Use color codes**: Blue for drafts, Green for finalized, Red for errors

### 🔁 BULK ENTRY FLOW

Each row captures:
- Transaction Date (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Description
- Reference (optional)
- Account (dropdown)
- Debit / Credit
- Upload File (optional receipt)
- Status (dropdown or inferred from submission action)

Each set is saved into:
- `journal_entries` table with status
- `journal_lines` table per line item
- Attachments linked per entry (optional)

---

### 🛑 VALIDATIONS

- All required fields must be completed before finalizing
- Amounts must balance (debit = credit for each row)
- Date must be string format (use format conversion from General Entry)
- Prevent null values in accounts or categories

---

### ⚙️ SYSTEM INTEGRATION

- Use **same logic** as working General Entry module for:
  - Entry creation
  - Ledger posting
  - Date formatting
- Do **not** post to ledger if status is “Draft”

---

### 🖥️ UI IMPROVEMENTS

- Finalized entries should have lock icon and light green background
- Drafts shown in amber/yellow background with edit option
- Add filter toggle: [ All | Finalized | Draft ]
- Add search by description or date

---

### 🧠 INTELLIGENT TOUCH

- Auto-fill account based on description (e.g. if "POS Sale", use 4000 - Sales)
- Pre-suggest categories from historical entries
- When uploading PDF or JPG, auto-suggest account using filename

---

### 🧪 QA TESTING POINTS

- Create 5 draft entries, confirm they do not affect reports
- Finalize 3 entries, confirm posted to journal & reflected in metrics
- Edit draft, finalize, and verify update in metrics

Fix “Initialize Default Permissions” 500 Error — Permissions Management Module

Prompt:

We are encountering a critical issue in the Permissions Management interface:

When clicking the “Initialize Default Permissions” button, the system sends a POST request to /api/admin/initialize-default-modules but returns a 500 (Internal Server Error).

The frontend correctly triggers the API, but the backend fails to process the request.

Error stack traces confirm this occurs inside the ModernPermissionsInterface.tsx and the related backend endpoint.

Required Fixes:
Backend Debugging

Review the API endpoint /api/admin/initialize-default-modules.

Check server logs to determine the root cause of the 500 error. Common issues include:

Database connection failure or schema mismatch (e.g., missing permissions or roles tables/columns).

Null or undefined values when assigning default permissions.

Missing default roles or configuration data.

Make sure the endpoint can safely create or reset default permissions for all available roles and modules, without requiring any missing seed data or configuration.

Implement robust error handling: If required tables/data do not exist, respond with a clear error message (not just 500).

Frontend Validation

Ensure that after a successful initialization, the frontend reloads the permissions matrix and displays a success toast.

If the backend returns a failure, show a descriptive error toast with the actual backend message.

Testing

Test the full flow by:

Clearing current permissions data (if safe in dev/staging).

Clicking “Initialize Default Permissions.”

Verifying that all default roles/modules/permissions appear as expected, and that each role can be further configured.

Confirm there are no blank/white screens, and error handling is visible and user-friendly.

Resilience

The API should be idempotent — clicking multiple times should not cause duplicates or further errors.

All seed/default roles and permissions should be defined in a safe, version-controlled way.

Mobile Responsive

Ensure the Role Selection UI and all permission grids work perfectly on mobile, as tested in Chrome DevTools responsive view.

Success Criteria:

No 500 errors when initializing permissions.

All roles show their default permissions matrix after initialization.

User gets a clear toast/alert on success or meaningful error feedback if anything goes wrong.

The UI and backend remain robust and scalable for future roles/modules.

Optional
If possible, add backend endpoint logs for easier troubleshooting next time.

Please resolve this issue urgently and provide a summary of the root cause and solution implemented.

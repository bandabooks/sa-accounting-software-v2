UI/UX Recommendations
Each feature should have its own tab/page.

Outstanding invoices

Quick links: New Invoice, New Quote, New Customer

Table/list views should allow quick search, filters, and export to PDF/Excel.

Every flow (estimate → order → invoice → payment) should be possible with as few clicks as possible.

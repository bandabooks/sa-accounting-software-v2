Current Issue:
When creating or editing subscription plans, admins are required to manually enter feature names and module permissions as JSON arrays or free text, which is error-prone, unfriendly, and does not match current SaaS industry standards.

Required Enhancements:

Add a module & permission selection interface:

Replace or supplement the free-text/JSON entry for modules and features with a modern, user-friendly multi-select control.

Display a list of all available system modules (e.g., Invoicing, Sales, Purchases, Inventory, POS, Accounting, Compliance, Projects, Reports, etc.) as clearly labeled toggle switches, checkboxes, or pill selectors.

Allow admins to easily select (or deselect) which modules are included in the plan with a single click.

Optionally, allow drilling down into each module to assign detailed permissions (e.g., view, create, edit, delete) if advanced control is required.

Live Preview:

Show a live preview or summary of selected modules and permissions before saving the plan.

Ensure Consistency:

When a subscription plan is assigned to a company, all users inherit permissions for the included modules (with further restrictions possible by role).

Validation:

Prevent saving a plan if no modules are selected.

Modern UX:

The selection controls should be visually clear, accessible, and mobile-friendly.

Example UI/UX Flow:

Module Selection

[✓] Invoicing

[✓] Customer Management

 Inventory

[✓] Basic Reports

 POS

 Compliance Management

 Project Management
(etc., as per available modules)

(Optional) Permission Details

[View] [Create] [Edit] [Delete] for each selected module

Benefits:
This will make the subscription management process more intuitive, reduce user errors, and align your platform with world-class SaaS solutions like QuickBooks, Zoho, and Xero.

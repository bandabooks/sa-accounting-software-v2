Fix All White/Blank Screen Issues Across the System
Objective:
Identify and resolve all instances where navigating to any page (e.g., /products) results in a blank or white screen. Ensure all pages in the system load the appropriate content and never show a blank screen, even in the case of errors.

Requirements & Steps:
Audit All Routes:

Systematically check every main navigation route and their subpages (/products, /clients, /sales, /expenses, /dashboard, /settings, etc.) for blank/white screen issues.

If any route renders blank (including modals, dialogs, or subcomponents), document the error and investigate the cause.

Error Boundary & Handling:

Implement a robust error boundary at the app root and main page layout levels.

All React errors (JSX, data fetching, missing imports, etc.) must be caught and should display a user-friendly error message or fallback UI, never a blank screen.

If a component fails to load due to missing data, API errors, or render errors, show a clear message ("Error loading page", "No data available", or the actual error), with options to retry or contact support.

Loading States:

Ensure all pages/components implement proper loading indicators while waiting for data or processing logic.

Never display an empty/white screen during data fetches or state transitions.

API & Data Fetching Issues:

Review all useQuery, useEffect, or data-fetching hooks for error handling.

If any API request fails or returns no data, ensure the UI displays an appropriate error, empty state, or retry option.

Validate all returned data structures and gracefully handle missing or unexpected values.

Component Imports and Exports:

Audit for missing or incorrectly named component imports/exports, which can cause blank screens on render.

Resolve all unresolved imports, typos, and ensure every page/component is properly exported.

404 and Route Guarding:

Implement a default 404 "Page Not Found" route for any undefined paths, never a blank screen.

If a user is unauthorized or session expires, redirect to login with an informative message.

Test All Devices and Browsers:

Test navigation and page loads on multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari) and mobile/tablet viewports to ensure no blank pages under any circumstances.

Regression Test:

After fixes, click through all links/menus in the app and confirm that all routes load content, loading indicators, or error messages as appropriate.

Confirm specifically that /products and any previously reported routes now load correctly.

Success Criteria:

No route, page, or modal in the system should ever show a blank/white screen under any circumstance.

All errors must be handled gracefully with user feedback.

All valid pages must display their respective content or a proper loading indicator.

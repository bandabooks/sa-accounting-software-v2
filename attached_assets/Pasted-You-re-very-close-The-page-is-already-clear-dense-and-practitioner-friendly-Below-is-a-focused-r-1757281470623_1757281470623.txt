You’re very close. The page is already clear, dense, and practitioner-friendly. Below is a focused review with prioritized changes so you get the most impact without churning.

Quick verdict

Layout order is right: KPIs → Timeline → Due Filings (center) with supporting blocks.

Visual contrast + spacing are professional.

It can ship, but a few tweaks will make it faster to operate day-to-day and safer for mixed roles.

Must-do (ship blockers / high ROI)

Make “Due Filings” the working surface (filters + bulk actions).

Add a thin filter bar above the list: Assignee (Me/Team) · Service (VAT/EMP/CIPC/…) · Entity · Status.

Add a list counter (“3 items”) and checkboxes + bulk actions (Assign, Request docs, Mark ready).

Keep “File” button per row; add aria-label like aria-label="File VAT201 Feb 2025 for ABC Pty".

Remove the empty “Upcoming Deadlines” card.
When no deadlines exist, don’t show a blank box—collapse it or replace with one sentence under the timeline: “No deadlines in the next 14 days.”

De-duplicate finance blocks.
You have Outstanding Balances and P&L Summary (good). Ensure there’s only one balances block site-wide on this page (no duplicates elsewhere). Add tiny links: “AR aging” and “AP aging”.

Role guard on actions.
“File” must be visible only to permitted practitioner roles. Clients should see Approve / Upload instead. (Server already enforces, but hide in UI to avoid confusion.)

Accessibility & focus

Every icon-only control needs an aria-label.

Ensure tab order: KPIs → Timeline → Due Filings → Tasks → Activity.

Keep visible focus rings on all interactive elements.

Should-do (quality & speed)

Header quick actions stay, but add one more: “Request Docs”.
Common first step when a return appears soon.

Timeline chips: show owner & severity consistently.
Chip label pattern: Service · Period and a right-side sublabel in 5d / overdue 3d. Color = info/warn/danger only.

Due Filings row info density.
Each row should show: Service chip · Entity · Period · Due date (+days) · Assignee · Status · Action.
Add a small paperclip indicator if docs are attached / pending.

Recent Tasks: group by due date.
Headings: Today, This week, Later. Keep “View all”.

Performance

React Query for this page: staleTime: 45s, refetchInterval: 60s.

Server list endpoints must support pagination & server-side filtering (assignee/service/status). Add DB indexes on (tenant_id, entity_id, due_date, status) for returns.

Nice-to-have (polish)

Portfolio scope switcher (top right of Due Filings): All clients / My portfolio / Unassigned.

Export small CSV for Due Filings (id, client, service, period, due, status, assignee).

Empty states
Use friendly sentences + a single CTA (e.g., “No filings this week — View calendar”).

Color tokens
Use semantic tokens (text-emerald-700, text-amber-700, text-rose-700) only; avoid extra tints for cleanliness.

AI bar placement
The “AI assistant loading” banner at the top is visual noise—move status into Settings → AI with a small inline dot in header if needed.

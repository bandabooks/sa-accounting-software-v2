Remove Duplicate Chart of Account Options in AccountSelect Component

We have an issue where the Chart of Accounts dropdowns (Income Account and Expense Account) in the products and services pages are showing multiple duplicate entries for each account (e.g., "4000 - Sales Revenue" appears four times instead of once). This is confusing for users and leads to potential data entry errors.

What Needs to Be Fixed
Ensure each account appears only once in all Chart of Accounts dropdowns, with no duplicates or triplicates.

This applies to both income (Revenue type) and expense (Cost of Goods Sold, Expense type) account dropdowns on the product/service forms.

Dropdown options should be displayed as:

[accountCode] - [accountName]

(e.g., "4000 - Sales Revenue", "5000 - Cost of Goods Sold")

Remove all duplicate account entries from the dropdowns regardless of how many are currently present.

Implementation Suggestions
Deduplicate the accounts list before mapping to dropdown options, using unique values for either accountCode or a combination of accountCode and accountName.

Ensure the filtering logic for account types (e.g., accountType === "Revenue" for income, accountType === "Cost of Goods Sold" for product expenses, accountType === "Expense" for service expenses) is applied after deduplication.

If there are duplicates in the database, identify and clean these up so that only unique accounts are stored per company.

For visual consistency, make sure that default selections (like "Product Sales" or "Service Revenue") also use the unique, deduplicated entry.

Acceptance Criteria
No account appears more than once in the dropdowns for any form/page.

New and existing products/services can be created or edited with only unique Chart of Account options.

The changes are applied globally to all account dropdowns in the system.

Summary:
Please update the Chart of Accounts dropdown logic so that each account appears only once in all related forms, with a clear format and correct account type filtering. This will greatly improve user experience and data accuracy.

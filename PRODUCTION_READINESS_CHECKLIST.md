## Critical Issues to Address Before Go-Live:
1. **AI Integration** - No centralized AI client, missing health checks
2. **Security Headers** - Missing CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
3. **Rate Limiting** - No API rate limiting implemented
4. **Monitoring** - No APM or error tracking in place
5. **Testing** - No automated test coverage
6. **Backup Strategy** - No database backup procedures

## Immediate Actions Required:
1. Implement centralized Anthropic AI client with health checks
2. Add security headers and rate limiting
3. Set up error tracking (Sentry)
4. Create critical path E2E tests
5. Document backup and recovery procedures
6. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

## Risk Assessment:
- **High Risk**: Missing AI health checks, no rate limiting, no monitoring
- **Medium Risk**: Limited test coverage, missing documentation
- **Low Risk**: Minor UI polish items, optimization opportunities

**Legend:**
- ‚úÖ Complete and production-ready
- üîÑ Partially complete, needs enhancement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical gap, needs immediate attention
- üö® Blocking issue for production
